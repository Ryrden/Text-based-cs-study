## About this repository

Whether you're a student looking to supplement your coursework, a self-taught programmer seeking to expand your knowledge, or simply interested in learning more about computer science, this repository is a valuable resource for you. Here you will find links to online textbooks, tutorials, documentation, and other text-based resources that cover a wide range of topics in computer science, from programming languages and algorithms to machine learning and data science.

Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to find the resources they need to learn and grow as a computer scientist. So dive in and start exploring the many text-based resources available here!

**Note:** This repository is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all text-based resources available on the internet. Rather, it is a curated list of high-quality, free resources that we have found to be particularly useful in our studies. If you have any suggestions for additional resources that you think should be included, please feel free to submit a pull request!
